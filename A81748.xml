            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that which bluſheth at its owne naked limbes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Language then it was firſt ſet forth in, takes new courage from the Front, it is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and put in hope by the Title which it carrieth, <hi>A Right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> For this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath skill to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend even the pooreſt gifts.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved in old Hiſtories, that <hi>Sinaetas</hi> a poore Country man brought water out of
<pb facs="tcp:170886:8"/> the River <hi>Cyrus</hi> to King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his Fiſts. This Preſent was received into a G lden Bottell, and reckoned for a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty treaſure. (<hi>Aelian. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Var. Hiſt. c.</hi> 32.) Nothing elſe made ſo ſlender a gift accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſo <hi>Good an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Conon</hi> an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman preſented a faire Rape to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> this was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a moſt acceptable Gift, and requited with gold.

<pb facs="tcp:170886:8"/> upon a Rape? <hi>Good Intention.</hi> For indeed neither Silver, nor Gold, nor any of thoſe things which are accounted for mighty matters is a kindneſſe, but the Will it ſelfe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer. And this is it which hath encouraged a meane perſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his will and good deſire in ſuch a ſmall peece of ſervice. For it is not ſo much to bee valued what is given, as with what mind: becauſe a mans reſpect conſiſteth not in that which is done or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but in the very
<pb facs="tcp:170886:9"/> mind of the Giver or Doer, that is, in <hi>His Good Intention.</hi> Even as alſo the honour of the Gods (ſaith the <hi>Romane</hi> Wiſe man) is not in Sacrifices, although they bee rich and garniſhed with gold, but in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and right meaning of the Offerers. (<hi>Seneca. l.</hi> 1. <hi>De benef. c.</hi> 6.) With the very ſame this Rule new limned, this ſingle Eye is here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and devoted to your moſt Gracious eyes.

Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> explaines this in the policy of the Eagle: She about to try her implumed birds,<note place="margin">Baſtard from the right breed</note> and to ſever the unkindly from the kindly, holds them aloft within her talons, and oppoſeth them to the Sun-beames; they which receive the Sun with open and undaunted eyes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for her brood, they

                  </gap>y loſe by a penitent Confeſſion; the guilt which by chance I ſhall draw upon me, I may wipe off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: let us goe on therefore, we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170886:20"/> ſhall have time enough to returne to our duty. Ah, this is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eye, nor if it be, is it long ſuch; for it lookes not upon God onely. If the Divell and Hell were a fable, that man would build a Heaven for himſelfe out of Heaven, and would beleeve himſelfe bleſſed, if he might live at his pleaſure; and wholly given to his belly like a Beaſt. This is their Intention for the moſt part whom <hi>Paul</hi> calleth naturall men, which perceive not the things that are of the Spirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Another way, the Intention is directed to God. Some man ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, becauſe hee deſires to live among the bleſſed; Heaven is ſweet to him: an eternall reward, a reward over and above great. He enclines his heart to doe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for retribution ſake. This Intention is much better then the firſt, yet not the beſt: I ſay it is better, for he which coveteth the joyes of Heaven,<note place="margin">Cautions,</note> is more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then he which onely feareth the torments of Hell, neither fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them alwaies, but ſometimes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170886:21"/> forgetfull of his dread, runs into that which is forbidden.</p>
               <p>The third way, he directeth his Intention moſt rightly to God, who concludes thus in his minde, I ſerue God, and therefore doe I ſerve him, becauſe this Maſter is moſt worthy to bee ſerved of all men; and becauſe he prevents me with exceeding and innumerable benefits: I owe all things to him, I deſire to pleaſe him, and for him I doe all things that I doe: I am not any ways ſolicitous of wages or reward: God I ſerve, and will ſerve whilſt I live, whereſoever my recompence be.</p>
               <p>This is the moſt Right Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, to doe all things not with a reſpect of ones ſelfe, but of God; not of gaine, but onely honeſty: Of this Intention the <hi>Hebrew</hi> King <hi>David</hi> making his boaſt: <hi>An Offering of a free heart</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>will I give thee, and praiſe thy Name (O Lord) becauſe it is ſo comfortable. Pſal</hi> 54.6. Here moſt eloquently Saint <hi>August. Why of a free heart,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>becauſe I freely love that which I praiſe; I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170886:21"/> praiſe God, and rejoyce in his praiſe, whoſe praiſe I am not aſhamed of.</hi> Let it be free, both what is loved, and what is praiſed, what is free? himſelfe for himſelfe, not for any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. What reward ſhalt thou receive of God, O thou covetous man? He preſerveth not the earth, but himſelfe for thee, who made Heaven and Earth. Voluntarily will I offer unto thee: doe it not then of neceſſity, for if thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt God for any other thing, thou praiſeſt him of neceſſity; if thou hadſt that preſent which thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, thou wouldſt not praiſe God. Marke what I ſay; thou praiſeſt God, namely, that hee might give thee a great deale of money: if thou couldſt have much money elſe-where, and not from God, wouldſt thou praiſe God at all? If therefore thou praiſeſt God for money, thou offereſt not freely to God, but offereſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; becauſe thou loveſt I know not what beſide him. Contemne all things, and attend him, love him of thy owne accord; becauſe thou findeſt no better thing which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170886:22"/> he can give, then himſelfe. And I will confeſſe unto thy Name (O Lord) becauſe it is ſo good; for nothing elſe, but becauſe it is good. What does hee ſay? I will confeſſe unto thy name, (O Lord) becauſe thou giveſt mee fruitfull lands, becauſe thou giveſt me gold and ſilver, becauſe thou giveſt me great riches, and excelling dignity: not, but why? becauſe it is good. I find nothing better then thy Name, therefore will I praiſe thy Name O Lord, becauſe it is good. <hi>Auguſ. Tom</hi> 8. in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Wee approve therefore of this Intention, as the beſt and pureſt, whereby a man does any thing, becauſe it ſo pleaſeth God, becauſe God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover it is eaſie to apprehend, whether a man conceive thus in his mind, for it falls out many times, that we raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe one another, and ſay in

Let God approve it, though all the world ſay nay, truely I weigh it not a ruſh; I have already learnt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and to be contemned.

               <p>But if any man, becauſe his things are not highly eſteemed by others, thinkes it a great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170886:26"/> is troubled, vexed, grieved, and falls in his mind, ſaying: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafter all my care ſhall be, that theſe Wits may not have what to condemne: it ſhall be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to me to be at eaſe,<note place="margin">Pleaſure,</note> then to under goe theſe perverſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Here is the principall matter, that man continually obſerve God, the end of all his actions.

This intention is as neceſſary for him that will live godly, as it is neceſſary for him to draw his breath, that will live naturally; and that for a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold cauſe. The firſt to drive away vaine glory: the other to encreaſe good deſerts. Vaine glory a vice moſt dangerous and alſo moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, ſo diverſly treacherous, that it can bee hardly avoyded. Other vices lay waite for us on earth, but this ſets traps almoſt in heaven it ſelfe; it invades him on all ſides that is buſied in vertues: Yea the more holily one liveth, by this it takes to it ſelfe the more liberty, and ruſhes on ſo much the bolder, by how much the more defence it ſees againſt it ſelfe; it encreaſeth, and gets ſtrength from our vertues. Every ſort of Vermine, as Froggs, Mice, Mothes, Beetles, Wormes, and ſuch kind of Creatures are bred of putred matter out of the earth: But this moſt filthy worme,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170886:42"/> vaine glory, proceedes out of a freſh and generous ſeed, out of large almes, out of rigid faſting, out of fervent prayers takes her birth, and ſpareth, as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>No State, Order, or Sexe, and being overcome riſeth up more vehemently againſt the Conquerour.</hi> Vaine glory is a ſtrong Hecticke ſucking up the marrow, and ſcarce ever, if it have poſſeſt a man, forſaking him, the firſt and laſt vice wee have to overcome, in <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion.</p>
               <p>How ſweet was it to the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> to repoſe at noone under his ſhady Gourd? one little worme confounded all that amenity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner our good workes flouriſh, like a tree ſpreading forth his fruitfull armes, but as ſoone as the worme of Pride bites this Tree, all things in a moment wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This little worme knowes how to hide her ſelfe ſo, ſo privily to gnaw, that they themſelves which ſwell with vaine glory, not onely take no notice of it, but not ſo much as beleeve him which notes, and gives them warning of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170886:42"/> it: This worme ſuffers it ſelfe to bee driven away, and gives place to the Charme, but preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes. It is not ſufficient that vaine glory hath once flowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſhe returnes a hundred times, a thouſand times ſhe returnes, and often with the greater aſſault. Therefore this venemous Serpent is daily, and more often to be laid at with ſacred Inchantments. A true Charme againſt this plague is that of the Kingly Prophet: <hi>Non nobis, Domine, non nobis: Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Lord, not unto us; but to thy name give the praiſe.

               <p>Behold even Heaven is not ſafe from theſe wormes. Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwads: <hi>Lay up for your ſelves treaſures in Heaven. Matt.</hi> 6.20. and yet neither ſo indeed are the things altogether ſecure, which are laid up there; vaine glory creeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with a thieviſh pace, privily a ſporteth the treaſures already laid up in Heaven, unleſſe a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention bee ſet for their Keeper, which yet may not goe a nailes breadth from the riches committed to her truſt: what good ſoever we have done at any time, whatſoever wee ſhall doe hereafter, let us fence on all ſides with a moſt right intention, unleſſe it delight us to ſpend our labour in vaine. The moſt difficult, as alſo the moſt excellent workes are of no moment, unleſſe a good intention accompany: all labour is vaine, which a right intention com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends not.</p>
               <p>This God lookes upon in all our actions, to this hee will aime the reward. Scarcely is there a greater or more memorable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, then for one to ſpend his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170886:44"/> life for another. But although one cloath a hundred Gibbets with his body, put on ſixe hundred tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wheeles, purple a thouſand Axes, and dye a thouſand times, unleſſe that bee done for Chriſt, in Gods cauſe, with a holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, hee may dye, but he ſhall never bee a Martyr; that ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him nothing unto heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Not paine, but the cauſe, but the purpoſe maketh Martyrs; as <hi>Hierom</hi> witneſſes, <hi>Hier.</hi> in <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Gal.</hi> The ſame reaſon is, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of greateſt moment.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the intention is of ſo great nobility, rightly in the divine Leaves is it called the heart. The heart is the beginning of life, ſuch a life, as a heart. A man turnes into a beaſt, if a beaſts heart bee planted in him; a beaſt turnes into a man, if a mans heart bee added to him. God would have <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> the King to bee made a Beaſt, and to live among them as one of them: therefore hee commanded, <hi>Let his heart be changed from mans, and let a Beaſts heart bee given him, Dan.</hi> 4.16.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170886:44"/> but GOD would that this Beaſt ſhould againe bee changed into a man; it was done: and, it ſtood upon his feet as a man, and a mans heart was given to it. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.4. Such is the intention, the heart of all things, which we doe.</p>
               <p>Conſider me here I pray you, the ſame ſentence pronounced in two Courts. In the Court of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Caiphas</hi> the High Prieſt being Preſident, in a full aſſembly of Senators it was ſaid: <hi>It is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us that one man dye for the people, and that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion periſh not. Ioh.</hi> 11.50. This the chiefe Prieſt Decreed, the reſt ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>The very ſame thing was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Court of Heaven, by the moſt Holy Trinity: <hi>It is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that one man dye for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> But this ſame decretory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, was indeed in the Counſell of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> a thing of greateſt folly and injuſtice; in the heavenly Counſell of greateſt Wiſedome and Iuſtice: there the Savage heart of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours by his malice and envie was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170886:45"/> ſtirred up, againſt this one man; but here the Divine Heart was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with exceeding love towards this man. Thus the heart is the beginning of life; and even as the heart being hurt, death is nigh to all the faculties of the ſame: ſo no worke of man can bee tearmed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which wants this heart, which is not for God: all labour is as good as dead, whatſoever is deſtitute of this living intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appianus Alexandrinus</hi> relates a marvelous thing of two heartleſſe Sacrifices. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the ſame day which hee fell in Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee went into the Senate, made the accuſtomed Offering: the beaſt opened, there was no heart. The <hi>Southſayer</hi> Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I know not what of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours death, Iulius</hi> laught, and commanded another to be brought, and this alſo wanted a heart. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous indeed, twice marvellous. <hi>Cicero l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Divin.</hi> And by what meanes could a Creature live without a heart, whether then at firſt conſumed, or elſe wanting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? if before, and how did it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170886:45"/> live? if then, and how was it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed? Whatſoever the matter bee, a Beaſt offered in Sacrifice without a heart, was a ſure meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death; ſo alſo a worke without a right intention, is a dead worke; unprofitable, none. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepe thy heart above all kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, for out of it are the iſſues of life. Prov.</hi> 4 23. Therefore how often ſoever wee undertake any buſineſſe, either about to pray, or to heare divine Service, or to give almes, or to doe any other thing; let us care for this onely, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, that ſuch a heart as this bee not wanting to us in theſe actions, that by a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention wee may doe all things for Gods honour. It is not vertue, nor any right deed, whereunto the beſt part of all, a right intention is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Looke to your ſelves that yee looſe not the things yee have wrought, but that you may receive a full reward. <hi>Ioh.</hi> Epiſt. 2.8.</p>

               <p>A Strange kind of Covenant, and almoſt incredible, if one ſhould thus agree with another: We will enter into friendſhip, but for the eſtabliſhment of a mutuall League, I will have thy Noſe cut off: thy Noſe ſhall bee to mee inſtead of Bonds, and Seale, and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet this bloody and barbarous Covenant would bee more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then that of <hi>Naaſh</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> with the men of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſh Gilead,</hi> which requeſted they might bee taken into League, and ſo would ſerve the King. To whom <hi>Naaſh</hi> the <hi>Ammonite: On this condition</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will I make a Covenant with you, that I may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170886:46"/> thruſt out all your right eyes.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. The cruell King would make the poore wretches wholly unfit for Warre, for the left eye was covered with a Buckler, the right hee would have thruſt out. This therefore hee did, that not onely they ſhould not know how to overcome, but alſo to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> the King of Hell, enters into friendſhip with man upon no other condition, then that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the right eye of a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee thruſt out of his head, that ſingle eye, to be directed unto God. As ſoone as this League is admitted, Satan ſounds a triumph; hee overcomes a man very eaſily, and makes him his Vaſſaile, for hee wants that, which onely is to bee uſed againſt the enemy. Of this right eye, which Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Single,</hi> hath hitherto beene intreated, how neceſſary, and how without this nothing can pleaſe God. Now moreover wee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, what is moſt agreeable with this eye, wherein chiefly a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>There was a cauſe why Chriſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170886:47"/> ſhould reprehend his Diſciples, wherein they ſeemed not at all to have deſerved reprehenſion. The ſeventy, ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with joy, ſaying: <hi>that even the Divells are ſubject unto us. Luk.</hi> 10.20. for indeed they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their parts with credit, and alſo had done miracles; were they therefore to bee ſorry, or weepe for this? but yet Chriſt replyes to their ſtory. <hi>Notwithſtanding in this rejoyce not: Your doings O my Diſciples, I miſlike not; but this truely is not to bee lookt upon in your deeds, let not your intention tend hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor indeed is this fountaine of joy pure enough, although this bee a rare and great gift, admirable and magnificent, this power over evill ſpirits, yet this worke is not yours, but my Grace, nor does it belong to your ſafety that the ſpirits are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but to others. Others there be, and more excellent gifts, in reſpect whereof you may ſoundly rejoyce; you are to make moſt of this one thing, that you are in good eſteeme with my Father: but rather rejoyce, that your names are written in the booke
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170886:47"/> of life.</hi> Luk. 10.20. <hi>at this let all your actions, your joy leavell at this.</hi>

               <p>Behold how the Heavenly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian hath wiped the ill-moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eyes of his, and dryed the fluxe of their not commendable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An ill intention alwaies lookes upon ſome fraile and vaine thing, and with that is vitiouſly contented. A good and pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deſires not but everlaſting things, and if it bee the pureſt, onely God.</p>
               <p>Wee ſaid in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that to beware a fault onely with that mind, left the fault may bee puniſhed in flames, is an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to bee condemned, but by no meanes pure; nor of ſo great price in Gods eſtimation. And even as that Citizen is not of ſo good note, which preciſely kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that Civicke law of not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Feaſts out of the City, yet not for reverence of the Law, but for love of his mony; hee ſpares his purſe, not his credit; for hee ſhould drinke ſo much dearer then another in Country Tavernes, therefore hee rather Gormandiſeth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170886:48"/> in the City: ſo neither is that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the pureſt intention, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Gods Law for that end, that it may bee lawfull to leade a life eternall in joyes: It is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and better then the former, but it ſavours of ſome ſelfe-love. It is the beſt and pureſt intention, and a truely <hi>Single Eye,</hi> which lookes upon God, onely ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, as that hee which hath this eye, may pronounce moſt ſincerely of himſelfe: <hi>I will ſerve God, for God.</hi> In this ſenſe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> King heretofore cries out; <hi>And, whom have I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in Heaven, but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee: My fleſh and my heart fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever. Pſal.</hi> 73.24, 25. For thee onely, O my Lord, will I willingly eſchew all things, which thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bee eſchewed; gladly will I doe and ſuffer all things, which ſhall come in my way to bee done or ſuffered.

Let no day paſſe, nor yet houre, wherein we readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not our ſelves to labour, and even to any trouble, with a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent repetition of this very thing in our mind: <hi>For thee Lord, for thee;</hi> both to abſtaine from this, and ſuſtaine that: I am ready to doe this, and to endure that; but <hi>for thee Lord, for thee.

                  <hi>Pure love,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>is not merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> It is not ignorant that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will follow the worke, but it never aimes at that, nor therefore ſpeakes well, that it may bee well fed; nor therefore does holily, that it may bee copiouſly repaid. Pure Love ſets God before it for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, which made all things for himſelfe, and for his owne glory: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16, 4. It is altogether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, that man ſhould refuſe to doe or ſuffer no thing for this ſame Lord and Maker: ſuch was that heavenly Spouſe, which ſaith that <hi>Shee kept all manner of pleaſant
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170886:49"/> fruites, both new and old for her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Cant.</hi> 7.13. The fruites new and freſh are, thoſe which ſpring from the Grace of God in the new Law, ſuch as are to love God, to beleeve and hope in God, to pray, to undergoe watchings, faſting, and other aſperous things for God; and this is to Crucifie the old man with the affections and luſts, and theſe are thoſe new and redolent fruits. The old fruits are thoſe workes of nature, to eate, to drinke, to repoſe, to talke of Affaires, and ſuch like, which yet are to bee offered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the new; that even when wee are to doe theſe things, wee ſhould never but ſay, <hi>For thee Lord,</hi> I will eate and drinke, <hi>for thee</hi> will I reſt, <hi>for thee</hi> will I doe all things, that I may pleaſe thee alone, although I diſpleaſe all men.</p>
               <p>And albeit it be not hard to doe thoſe workes of the firſt ſort for Gods ſake, yet thoſe workes of the ſecond ſort is hard, whereas the inferiour ability of the ſoule, and more depraved nature, drawes to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170886:49"/> it with an incredible affection, whatſoever it knowes gainefull and pleaſant to it ſelfe; hither it wholly haſteneth, and does that of all that it may not fare ill, and if left to it ſelfe, ſerves its owne turne moſt carefully. Therefore ſhee is to bee compelled by force,<note place="margin">Nature.</note> that ſhe permit all thoſe things to be done for God; that therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man may bee willing to eate, drinke, ſpeake, ſleepe, becauſe that pleaſeth God; all in that manner as ſhall bee pleaſing to him.

                  </gap>er this manner: <hi>Let him come to the Table with a minde not to looſe, and gaping onely after the meate, which onely may command; bring away, bring away, the meate is my owne, I dip in mine owne Platter, I live at mine owne coſt, therefore I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170886:50"/> will take care that I may doe well, and feele my ſelfe live. We muſt not ſo ſpeake, nor ſo eate, but reſolve this in our minde: I have GOD my overſeer, therefore I will take meate in that manner, that none bee offended therewith, Gods glory not diminiſhed: I will not bee the ſlave of my belly, that here I may follow pleaſure onely; neither indeed doe I live that I may eate, but eate that I may live: and may bee ſit to take paines. In a word, hee that will take repaſt without offence, let him never eate and drinke, but doe the ſame to the praiſe of God;</hi> For thee Lord, for thee <hi>will I eate and drinke; thee will I ſeeke for mine end in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is this to bee our cogitation at that very time when wee come to the Table? It is to bee noted here, that there is one intention which is called <hi>Actuall,</hi> another which is called <hi>Vertuall;</hi> the <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> is, when one offers to God that which hee doth whiles hee doth it, or whiles hee begins to doe. And ſurely with this intention wee muſt begin every day, before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170886:50"/> wee doe any thing, by offering to Gods glory, whatſoever wee are about to doe.</p>
               <p>But it is expedient to ſet before God not a confuſe company of workes, and all on an heape, but expreſly and premeditately the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the enſuing day in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>My God, whatſoever this day I ſhall ſpeake, or doe; yea whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſball thinke, I offer wholly to thee: Theſe and theſe prayers, that and that buſineſſe, thoſe and theſe my affaires I conſecrate to thee; nor deſire any thing elſe, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I ſhall performe this day, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre, my God, may wholly turne to thy honour.</hi> This intention whilſt it is thus conceived in the morning is <hi>Actuall,</hi> for then the will is in operation. With this ſo begun one goes into the Church, into the Market, into the Court; or ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tennis-Court, any place of honeſt Recreation, nor thinks any further, that hee goes hither or thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Gods honour: and then his intention which in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was <hi>Actuall,</hi> beginneth to be <hi>Vertuall,</hi> if ſo bee that any power
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170886:51"/> thereof ſticke faſt in thoſe remote actions, even as a ſtone being flung with the hand, whirling aloft through the aire, is ſwayed, and carried not with his owne weight, but by force of hand. Heere the perpetuall cuſtome of the Saints is to bee noted, who not contented with that matutine Reſolution, to congeſt all their deeds as it were upon an heape, and ſo deliver them to God in groſſe, but as often as they take any new matter in hand, ſo often they renew their intention, alwaies repeating that with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <hi>Lord, I will doe this for thee, for thee will I labour; I will think this for thee; for thee will I hold my peace now, and now will I ſpeake for thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the perpetuall courſe of upright men; and there are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines which deny the ſaid matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine intention alone to bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to conſecrate all the actions of the day to God. For it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the <hi>Virtuall</hi> intention at leaſt wiſe perſwade and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote action: but what enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there from the morning intention, when one at noone
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170886:51"/> comes to the Table, being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the time, by hunger, by cuſtome, without any remembrance of God, or the Divine Honour. There is not in that matutine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any other ſtrength, then that thereby the things be thought good, which afterward are done as it were by command thereof; but thoſe things onely are put in execution, which proceed from hence by a force not interrupted: but that againe oblivion, cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diverſe naturall action breaks off. From hence it appeares, that it is not ſufficient for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, ſo as to worke deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly in all his actions, to offer himſelfe wholly to God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the day, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of doing all things to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but it is neceſſary that this purpoſe be effectuall, &amp; hereunto a generall intention is not enough, but it is requiſite, that it bee pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly ſet downe, as for example: A ſumme of mony to bee given to the poore, which moreover by the vertue of that purpoſe may bee diſtributed. This is the mind

               </p>
               <p>From hence alſo it is cleare, why Chriſt to good deeds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a reward of glory, yet not without this Appendix; <hi>if they bee done for his Name ſake.</hi> A purpoſe conceived in the beginning of the weeke or the day, of doing all things for the love of God to his glory, is truely an Act of Charity and Religion, ſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and of greater worth, by how much the more ample and extended object it hath; yet it puts not the excellency thereof upon all the actions of that day or weeke: for, that the workes following out of ſuch an act, may procure Gods love and heavenly glory, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they bee effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; out of a good intention either actuall or vertuall are the things, which proceed from her power, as a Tree ſprings out of the ſeed. As if a man bee going ſome farre jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, about a matter undertaken for Gods glory, all actions to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the way, or labours to bee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170886:52"/> endured, ſhall bee of ſingular good eſtimation, if thoſe bee exerciſed, theſe endured out of the ſtrength and neceſſity of that purpoſe never recalled. And that wee may ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily ſpeake; the worke of a righteous man gaineth eternall glory, if it bee governed by the act of charity, or a right intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bee referred to GOD, as to its laſt end, either by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act of a good intention (which is to bee actually referred) or by the fore paſſed, from whence it may proceed as from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe, which is to bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vertually.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if wee deſire to imitate the examples of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, if wee doe out of vertue, if to conſecrate all our actions to God, let us by no meanes bee weary of this not laborious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but with a matutine purpoſe renewed oft through the day, and with an actuall intention (which goeth with a ſurer foote then the vertuall) let us dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God will not have a Pidgeon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, unleſſe a Turtle Dove be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, to wit, that Bird which belongs to the kinne: hee admits not a Vultur, not a Lapwing, not a Hawke, into the Society, but a Turtle Dove; for indeed God requireth, that to all things which wee offer unto him, wee adjoyne the Dove, a ſincere Intention: but if any one to this Dove joyne a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170886:56"/> ſtinking Lapwing, hee ſhall offer a moſt ingratefull Sacrifice. Let the Turtle bee with the Pidgeon, let a deed every way not evill be with a good intention: otherwiſe the Pidgeon and the Lapwing are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in unequall marriage. A good intention, and an evill worke, is a hatefull Sacrifice to God.

This is nothing elſe, then to thruſt the Pigeons and the Lapwing into one Sacrifice, to goe about to cloath an evill worke with a good intention, which is nothing ſo. But thou maiſt not without cauſe aske the queſtion: why can not a good intention make an evill worke good, when as an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention may make a good worke evill? From whence I pray hath an evill intention ſo much force, that it can corrupt even the beſt worke, whereas a good intention is not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170886:56"/> of ſo great ſtrength, that it can heale an evill worke? A good worke is contaminated with an ill intention, and how comes it to paſſe that an evill worke cannot be amended by a good intention? if faſting out of covetouſneſſe bee of no worth, why is not the ſtealing of Bond-men out of mercy a thing of ſome deſert? moſt clearely Chriſt: <hi>If thine eye</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall bee full of light: but if thine eye bee evill, thy whole body ſhall be full of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> It ſeemeth therefore in equall right, that a good intention ſhould bee able to performe in an evill worke, what an ill intention can in a good worke.

Why doe wee not ſuppreſſe, although wee can, true Wills or Teſtaments, and put falſe in the place? that unworthy people may not have Lands or Legacies, which doe no good out of them, but rather they by whom the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry are fed, the naked are cloathed ſtrangers entertained, captives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, Churches reared? why may not thoſe evills be done for theſe good things ſake, if for theſe good things ſake, neither are thoſe things evill: Who may ſay theſe things, but hee which endevours to turne the world and all rights and cuſtoms upſide downe? <hi>Auguſt.

               <p>How ill therefore doe Parents provide for themſelves and their Children, whiles they gape after all kind of gaine, that they may not leave their iſſue in a meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.

               <p>In the yeare nine hundred forty nine, <hi>Thuis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> with a mighty Army invaded <hi>Italy.</hi> King <hi>Berengarius</hi> caſt about how to free the <hi>Italian</hi> Coaſt, and to repell the enemy; a good end, a very good intention, ſo hee had uſed a good meanes in the buſineſſe: but ſurely he tooke no good courſe, hee did ſo pill the Temples and Houſes of the Commonalty, that from all parts hee ſhaved a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty treaſure, out of which the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> could eaſily meaſure ten buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of mony, whatſoever remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hee kept to himſelfe, being made richer even by meanes of his enemy. <hi>Luitprand.

               <p>So alſo when one deſires to be cured, and made well of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, a very good end: but hee ſends to Fortune-tellers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to Diviners, and Wizards; to Conjecturers, and Magitians,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170886:63"/> this now hee doth very ill, neither ſhall hee cleare his offence with an honeſt end. So one ſues for an Office, Calling, Dignity; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to riſe, an end in it ſelfe not evill. <hi>If a man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, hee deſireth a good worke.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. but if hee goe about this, leaſt a poorer, though a fitter man then hee come before him, if hee bee free of his monie and gifts, if after much beſtowed hee promiſe more, and ſo climbe high by Silver ſtaires, or if otherwiſe he remove another out of his place, that hee may ſucceed into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they are naughty deeds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that which hee affecteth be not evill.</p>
               <p>So ſome body elſe deſires an end of a ſuite at Law, ſurely hee longs for a good thing, but becauſe hee anoynts theſe and theſe mens hands with ſilver, and drawes them with bribes to his ſide, therefore hee corrupts and deſtroys a good end with baſe liberality. Evill is not to bee done, that good may come of it: I may lawfully goe into a Chamber, but not through
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170886:64"/> the windowes. So all actions which are deſtitute of Chriſtian Prudence, ſhall never put on the credite of true vertue, although they bee done with the beſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Without Prudence no act is good. <hi>Bee yee wiſe as Serpents. Math.</hi> 10.16. Nor does it excuſe to ſay: I thought it was to bee done ſo, I thought not this hurt would have followed, I thought this man was to bee puniſhed.

But if a good intention cannot throughly correct an evill action, what will it bee to adde an evill worke to an evill intention? if to uſe good things ill be evill, to uſe evill things ill will bee worſt of all.

The Gnat is a much ſmaller Fly; how ſlender a Nebb hath it? yet therewith as with a Gimlet it draweth blood, and the part which it hath wounded, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſwelleth.<note place="margin">More ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till</note> What is thinner then the ſting of a Scorpion? the eye can ſcarce perceive it, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as with an inviſible Dagger the whole man is ſtabb'd to death. How great a lumpe of Dowe doth a little Leaven paſſe through in a few houres? one little meaſure of Vineger, or a drop of Gall, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a whole Veſſell of generous Wine. An ill intention is ſo ſtrong and cruell a Poiſon, that it depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170886:75"/> any good action whatſoever. Wee have hitherto entreated of a good intention, what it is, and how neceſſary. Now moreover we will diſcourſe of an evill one, and declare how this Leaven, how this filthy poiſon infecteth the beſt things: how this ſubtill ſting of a Scorpion killeth without more adoe.</p>
               <p>The Statue appearing to King <hi>Nabuchadnezer,</hi> was a prodigy for price, matter, and magnitude; an incomparable Tower of Gold, Silver, Braſſe, Iron. But becauſe the lower part thereof was not firme, becauſe the feet were of Earth and Clay, therefore one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtone did ſo ſhiver this precious heape, that not ſo much as a Tyle was left fit for uſe. <hi>Then was the Iron, the Clay the Braſſe, the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Gold broken in pieces together: and became like the Chaffe of the Summer threſhing floores, and the winde carried them away. Dan.</hi> 2.35. Even ſo an ill intention doth ſo batter a good worke whatſoever it be, that it leaves it not the leaſt goodneſſe behind. That which

Thoſe two hundred and fifty ſeditious Princes of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offered incenſe; every one of theſe had his Cenſer. Thou wouldſt have ſaid there had beene as many Prieſts, as there were heades of this Function. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt them ſtood <hi>Aaron</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So on both ſides they did the ſame thing, as if they had ſtrove who ſhould better execute this Office: which part therefore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came? which did more pleaſe the Lord? God was extreamely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all, not becauſe their Cenſors were little worth. <hi>For</hi> Aarons <hi>Cenſor was of the pureſt Gold, but theſe mens Braſen.</hi> Vide Iacob.

That hee might thruſt a good Father out of his Throne, and reigne himſelfe, hee invented all theſe things, all tended hither.

The <hi>Phariſee</hi> goes on: <hi>I fast twice in the weeke, I give Tithe of all that I poſſeſse. Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. Both of them commendeth himſelfe, the Prayer of both is the ſame in ſubſtance: Why therefore did his pleaſe, but this mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe? Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> reſolving this doubt: <hi>It falleth out many times,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that the juſt and unjuſt have words alike, but yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies an unlike heart: and out of what ſpeeches the Lord is offended
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170886:79"/> by the unjuſt, in the ſame manner alſo hee is well pleaſed of the juſt.</hi> Behold the <hi>Phariſee</hi> juſtifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in deed, <hi>Ezechiah</hi> in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: why therefore doth he offend, and this pleaſe? Almighty God weigheth every mans words by his thoughts, and they are not proud in his eares, which proceed out of an humble heart.</p>
               <p>But I propoſe other two, doing very like one another with farre different conceites. <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> a holy man, and the <hi>Trojan</hi> adulterer <hi>Paris,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> as they remember of him, ſitting at meate, caſt his eyes very ſtedfaſtly upon a beautifull woman, being demanded the cauſe of it by one that ſate neare ſomewhat offended thereat: <hi>I admired</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Creator of the World: for if there be ſo much beauty and comlineſſe in created things, the Maker and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator himſelfe muſt needs be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more comely and beautifull; if fraile men doe ſo excell in favour in this Pilgrime ſtate, what ſhall the bleſſed bee after the reſurrection in Heaven?

                  <hi>I propoſe three other Perſons, Chriſts mother, Christs Diſciple, but whom hee called a Divell, and Chriſts Hosteſſe, whoſe Action was in a manner all one, but their intention moſt unlike. The mother of Chriſt a thouſand times ſaluted her Son in his ſwadling bands with a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170886:80"/> reverend kiſſe.</hi> Magdalen <hi>kiſſed the Lords feet with like reverence, when</hi> Simon <hi>the Phariſee was reprehended for neglecting this duty: but even</hi> Iudas Iſcariot <hi>alſo faſtned a kiſſe on his Maſters mouth. Here is as unlike deſert, as intention. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obtaineth a mighty encreaſe of Gods love and favour.</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen <hi>pardon of her ſinnes,</hi> Iudas <hi>Hell. From whence is this ſo great inequality in a mother, Diſciple, Servant, kiſſing the very ſame man? The Mother did this out of moſt chaſt love;</hi> Magdalen <hi>with a moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection;</hi> Iudas <hi>with a moſt wicked deſire of betraying him. That which hath an evill end, is it ſelfe alſo evill. The ſame is to ſee in many other things, one ſtayeth by his ſicke friend, not becauſe he is a good friend, and mindfull of his duty, but becauſe he is an inſinuating companion, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Raven, which from the next hill, ſpieth Cattell fainting ſick, and ready to kicke up their heeles; he waiteth for death, and expecteth a Legacy. Loe how an ill intention doth moſt filthily corrupt a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In like manner, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170886:81"/> Zacheus <hi>deſired to ſee Chriſt; the action of both was all one, but unlike the intention. The Chirurgeon binds a ſicke party very faſt, hee wounds his arme, cutteth off his hand, ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off his legge, yet thankes are given him, and Gold for his paiment. A Thiefe likewiſe maimeth a man, but the Gallowes is due to him for his reward: and the reaſon is, hee addreſseth his weapon, that hee may cure the hurt, but this man, that he may hurt the ſound.</hi>

                  <hi>After the ſame manner a godly man takes up a ſtone, that hee may lay it unto the building of a Church; an angry man alſo takes up a ſtone himſelfe, but that hee may throw it at him whom hee ſtomacks. Two men goe together to an eminent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the one in ſome religious behalfe, the other to kill his enemy; a reward from Heaven belongs to the one; to the other from Hell.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170886:81"/> he launced an Impoſtume, which the Chirurgions hand feared, and cured him by a deſperate adventure, whoſe deſtruction hee longed for? perceive you how there is not any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the action it ſelfe, but in the intent of the doer: ſo he ſeemeth not to have conferred a benefit, which did good with an evill mind; for the benefit came by chance, an injury by the man.

And for as much as thoſe which I ſayed, are lurking faults, an evill intention addeth an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable weight to them, with marvellous celerity; Therefore the Divell cares not ſo much what good or evill wee doe, ſo hee can obtaine this, that wee may doe good with an ill intention. <hi>Gregory</hi> of this craft of the Divell: <hi>He ſeeth the whole Tree,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>to bring forth fruite for him, which he hath infected in the root with his vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tooth.</hi> And in <hi>Bernards</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a naughty intention doth quite Condemne a good man.

               </p>
               <p>But there is a ſort of Vizards in the world to bee found all about, whom GOD will never admit into Heaven, namely, good workes clad with an evill intention. It may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170886:82"/> be ſaid of theſe Divels elfes: <hi>A wolfe playes the Thiefe in Sheeps clothing, vice goeth in the habite of vertue. Satan looketh like an Angel of light.</hi> Iob. <hi>Mine owne clothes,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>ſhall abhorre me.</hi> Iob. 9.31. <hi>I am ſo filthy, and full of lothſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that mine owne Garments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mee, as if they ſcorned to touch a man ſo impure.</hi> The Garments are externall good workes, theſe doe abominate, condemne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne him, which inwardly and in mind is ſo ulcerous, and flowes with evill intentions, even as if they grieved, that a man ſhould bee ſo faire without, and foule within. <hi>If thine eye bee evill, thy whole body ſhall bee full of darkneſſe,</hi> although thou put a ſheep skin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, or a cloake of vertue, or an Angels Garment. <hi>Gregory: When even any right thing is done with a perverſe meaning, although it bee ſeene to ſhine bright before men, yet it is proved darke by the examination of the ſecret Iudge.</hi> Greg. <hi>l.</hi> 28 <hi>mor. c.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>And this God evidently ſhewed on a certaine time. The ſame holy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170886:83"/> Writer relates a marvellous thing in this manner: <hi>Fortunatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Todi,</hi> a man of wonderfull ſanctity, by Prayer caſt out a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell which poſſeſt a man, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell being driven out of his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that hee might make up his injury, God ſo permitting, put on the habite of a Traveller, whom counterfetting out of ſubtiltie, he came into the City about twilight, and like a poore exile began to caſt out complaints againſt Biſhop <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and, Loe, ſaith hee, what a holy man is <hi>Fortunatus</hi> your Biſhop; ſee what hee hath done, hee hath excluded a man which is a ſtranger, and over-taken by ill fortune from his Lodging: Whither ſhall I goe? there is none that may receive mee into his houſe. Whiles hee maketh this lamentation, a Citizen heareth it, ſitting by him, the Fryer with his wife and little Child, and by and by with an envious curioſity he enquireth more narrowly, what wrong the Biſhop had offered him? As ſoone as hee heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the ſubtile ſtranger,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170886:83"/> freely offered his owne houſe for an Inne, not ſo much that hee might ſhew courteſie to a ſtranger, as that hee might traduce the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop whom hee wiſhed very ill: So drew the counterfeit Divell along with him to the Fyer ſide. Heere when they had had much diſcourſe, his Gueſt ſuddenly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out a doores, takes up the Child, and with all violence throwes him into the fire, and killed him. <hi>Greg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Dial. c.</hi> 9. Alas wretched Parent, confeſſe at length, either whom thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt into thy Houſe, or whom your Biſhop rooſted out of his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hoſpitality is a moſt laudable vertue, but if an evill intention de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave it, it degenerates from vertue to vice. To entertaine ſtrangers was a moſt commendable thing even in that great <hi>Abraham,</hi> but if a good meaning bee wanting, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell is as ſoone received as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. All other vertues are in the ſame manner, whereunto if a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked intention inſinuate it ſelfe, the evill ſpirit findeth an open Inne, which hee may take up at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170886:84"/> and maketh a man an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, that hee may adore his owne belly, his owne mony, his owne Treaſure Cheſt, or the Table whereon hee eates, which is ſeene to bee the courſe in every deadly ſin. <hi>If thine eye be evill, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkeneſse.</hi> Ah, how circumſpectly muſt we attend here, that wee weary not our ſelves in vaine, and throw away our paines, leaſt we looſe all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to bee obtained by good deeds, by an intention that is not good.

               <p>One of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends demandeth of him: <hi>Can the Ruſh grow up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mire? or can the Flagge grow without water? Iob.</hi> 8.11.

So you may find many, whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Hee asketh the mony of a little tranſitory ſpeech,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170886:86"/> for that which might gaine him the Kingdome of Heaven. Hee ſelleth his worke therefore at a ſorry rate, becauſe he doth great matters, but hath ſmall commings in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> when hee had invited ſome of his more noble friends to Supper, and had commanded the Banqueting roome to bee dreſt up after the beſt faſhion; in ruſheth <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick, and with his beaſtly and durty feet began to trample the Carpets. <hi>Plato</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with his Gueſts: What doſt thou, ſaith hee, O <hi>Diogenes?</hi> I tread upon <hi>Platoes</hi> pride, ſaith hee: Thou treadeſt upon it anſwered <hi>Plato,</hi> but with another greater pride. There was certainely a more unbridled kind of ſtate in the mind of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> becauſe he was poore, then in <hi>Platoes,</hi> who preſented all that bravery to the eyes of his friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to himſelfe. So you may find very many, both proud and poore together, which in their owne eyes ſeeme better and holier then other men, which are rich onely under this colour, becauſe they have nothing: as if the Lord
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170886:87"/> had commended a low eſtate, not a lowly mind; and as though it were vertue to want, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take want in good part. That ſame <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſuffered many things hard to bee borne, but with that mind, that hee might draw every bodies eyes to looke upon him. Therefore when in the deep of Winter hee went into the cold water to waſh himſelfe, and the people came in aboundance to the ſpectacle; and ſome alſo pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man, did as well entreat that hee would ſpare himſelfe. <hi>Plato</hi> among the lookers on cryed out:<note place="margin">Si vuitis miſereri, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>If yee will have pitty upon him, get you gone. Plato</hi> knew the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this diſeaſe, which is then forſaken of its owne ſtrength, when it wants the eyes and eares of others.</p>
               <p>Take heed that yee doe not your Almes before men, <hi>to bee ſeene of them:</hi> as much as others doe ſeeke the eyes of men, ſo much doe you avoid them. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounts him magnanimous, which will have neither more nor leſſe honour beſtowed upon him,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170886:87"/> then is fit, <hi>Ariſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 25. But in the Academy of Chriſt this precept is exploded. Chriſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him magnanimous, which can deſpiſe all honour, and himſelfe moreover. Surely no honour what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall bee a reward worthy enough for vertue. Honour is a light and inconſtant poſſeſſion, and playes the runagate like a ſtranger, nor is in the power of the honoured, but of the honourer. Therefore Chriſt pittying our childiſhneſſe, ſo carefully warneth: Take heed that yee ſell not your vertues at too vile a price: If yee will be <hi>Seene</hi> of men, GOD will turne his eyes from you. Take heed, otherwiſe yee ſhall have no reward of your Father which is in Heaven. Therefore be not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived; the greateſt honour for the leaſt good deed, is every way an unequall and unworthy reward.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>And when he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the chiefe Prieſts, and Scribes of the people together, hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them, where Chriſt ſhould be borne.</hi> What was the intent of <hi>Herod</hi> in this? To know the place where the Child was borne. What hurt I pray is this? This forſooth, becauſe there is no good at all therein. To deſire to know, is of it ſelfe indeed, as they call it, an indifferent intention, which is neither good nor evill; hereunto if an evill action be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, <hi>Then</hi> Herod <hi>when hee had privily called the Wiſe men, enquired of them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently what time the Starre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Neither is this a ſigne of a good intention.

Such a Soule is never but in travaile with good deſires, of ſerving God more faithfully and reſpectfully; neither onely is ſhe in travaile, but hath iſſue alſo, and brings her holy purpoſes to effect, ſhe is happily delivered, and gives the world a fight of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deeds in all kinds. And as a great-bellyed woman is of a very dainty ſtomacke, and loathes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times thoſe things that before ſeemed meere Hony to her, and longs for thoſe that before were in her conceit like gall: So the mind of man great with chaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, abhorreth all the pleaſures of the fleſh, all the world; but in the meane time it embraceth all adverſe things whatſoever, and the whole proviſion of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with great affection. Heere the ſeaven-headed Dragon watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170886:146"/> and layeth waite every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hee may infect that mind, either with ſecret pride, or ſubtile avarice, or blind envy, or privy luxury, or againe with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but glozing, or with any other faire-ſeeming, but ſiniſter intention. So the Hell-armed Serpent ſtands gaping before the woman, ready to bee delivered. What therefore muſt the Soule doe in this caſe, if even by the leaſt token a wrong intention bewray it ſelfe, what reſiſtance muſt be made? Let the Child be ſnatched up <hi>to GOD and to his Throne,</hi> let the intention advance it ſelfe to the Creator by theſe wings of prayer. My Lord, I have done, and am about to doe this for love onely of thee. And let the woman fly into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let the Parent of this Child ſay: <hi>I deſire not, my Lord, to bee ſeene to be knowne, I affect not to be praiſed: I will not have it proclaimed in the Market, I will not have it commended for a mighty and rare thing, I would have this done ſo, as if I had done it in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170886:146"/> deſert, in the moſt deſert Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: So thou, my GOD, knoweſt it, as thou knoweſt all things: thou onely art a Theater large enough for all my actions.</hi>

                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, that approved Souldier to God above, ſent all his Sons and Daughters, that is, all his good workes before him into Heaven. Therefore the Angell moſt courteouſly ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſaying: <hi>Thy prayers and thine almeſ-deeds are come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for a memoriall.</hi> Acts 10.4. <hi>For hee was a devout man, and one that feared God, and prayed to God alwaies.</hi> Thus all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were caught up <hi>to God, and to his Throne,</hi> that <hi>Stygian</hi> Dragon being deluded, which exceedeth all Theeves, Pirates, Robbers by many degrees. For this roving Theefe is never but in hand with his wiles, he obſerveth a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler before he paſſeth by, and alſo in his very paſſage.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170886:147"/> to pull a Right Intention in pieces, which <hi>Gregory</hi> eloquently ſetting forth: <hi>For we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the old enemy purſueth our good workes three manner of waies, that the very ſame thing which is done right before men, may be ſpoyled in ſight of the inward Iudge.</hi> For ſometimes in a good worke he polluteth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that every thing which followeth in action, may for ſo much not come forth pure and cleane, as he diſtempers it in the very Originall. But ſometimes he is not able to corrupt the intent of a good worke, but oppoſeth it in the action it ſelfe as it were by the way ſide,<note place="margin">Subiuncto latenter vitio, quaſi ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiis peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur.</note> that when one makes account he goeth out more ſecure, by ſetting vice privily to dog him, he may bee killed as it were by treachery. But ſometimes he neither corrupteth the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ſupplanteth by the way ſide, but entraps a good worke in the end of the action, and how much farther hee faines himſelfe to be gone from the houſe of the heart, or the paſſage of the deed,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170886:147"/> he waiteth ſo much more craftily to diſappoint an action at the journies end: and by what meanes he makes every one that is not wary ſecure by thinking him farre enough off, thereby hee ſuddenly runs them through with a harder and more incurable wound. For ſo hee contaminates the intention in a good worke, becauſe when hee perceiveth the hearts of men eaſie to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he preſents the aire of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory favour to their deſires, that in theſe things which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme right, they may be enclined by the ſtrength of intention, to covet baſe matters: whereupon it is rightly ſaid by the Prophet under the ſimilitude of <hi>Iudea,</hi> of every ſoule which is caught in the trap of a wretched intention.<note place="margin">Facti ſunt hoſtes eius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capite.</note>

Righteous men not much unlike to birds, have their habitation indeed on high, but they fly downe to the waters for their food, and dip themſelves therein: they refuſe not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe cares, vexations, labours, diverſe troubles; they carry theſe waves upon their backes, for no otherwiſe are good workes made evident; there is need of ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and induſtry.

In this manner the godly get the nouriſhment of their ſoules. But the Divell, like a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> aſſaulteth the head of theſe birds, Intention. Doth he ſee one praying? he plucks away the rule of a right intention, and, many, ſaith he, looke upon thee; let them goe now and ſay if they

Does he ſee money in the hand for the poore? he ſnatcheth away the eyes after ſpectators of the almes, or draweth the eares to the beggers importunate cryes, that whiles hee gives almes, hee may give a reproach with it, and ſay looke here ſhameleſſe Dogge, ceaſe to barke. <hi>Moſt men will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime every one his owne goodnes: but a faithfull man who can find?</hi> Prov. 20.5.

               <p>The Hawke, as Fables tell, derided the Wren, that Bird which uſeth the water ſide, that whereas it was not unlike him in colour, yet had ſuch a degenerous ſtomacke, that it had rather live upon Wormes, and ſorry victuals, then feed upon the ſweet fleſh of other birds. To whom the Wren: There is no reaſon, ſaith he, that thou ſhouldſt ſo much as rejoyce, my Brother, for the good cheere which is none of thine owne, and which thy unjuſt prolling gets thee. I that am contented with meaner dyet, enjoy greater peace then thou, and the time will come perhaps, when you ſhall pay deare for your dainty belly, and ſhall repent too late that ever you tooke up theſe hunting ſports without right or reaſon. This Bird might have ſeemed to bee a Prophet. For not many dayes after, the Hawke in the very midſt of his game was taken by a Country man, whoſe Pidgeons
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170886:174"/> he purſued, &amp; hanged out at a high Tower in the manner of other birds, for a terrour to the reſt.

                  <p>God ordained in the old Law, that the Prieſt ſhould not give Iudgement of the Leproſie, before the Seventh day.

And it comes to paſſe ordinarily, that we fall into the ſame things our ſelves, which we condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in others, that at leaſt by this meanes we may learne to be aſhamed of our folly. So that old <hi>Mechetes</hi> (as <hi>Casſian</hi> reporteth) complaining againſt himſelfe, ſaid: <hi>I have found fault with my Brethren in three things, and have grievouſly tranſgreſſed my ſelfe in the very ſame Caſſ. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Inſtit. c.</hi> 30.

Hee pulleth out the leaſt mote that ſticks in anothers eye with great care, but is ſo far from caſting the beame out of his owne, that he doth not ſo much as ſee it. This is the manner of raſh judgement, to ſpare no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, to lay a cenſure on every one that comes in the way, to ſuſpect the worſt that can be of others, to ſearch out and examine all mens intentions, not to know himſelfe at all.

By this evident token, it is very eaſie to diſtinguiſh men and women of ſober diſcretion from fooles. And even as Bees, when the weather is raynie, and ſtormy cloudes hover in the aire, betake
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:170886:243"/> themſelves into their Hives to make honey: ſo men of a good mind, and no venemous mouth, deſcend into themſelves, they live privately within, and make the honey of good thoughts, and fly not abroad at their perill, when as they ſee the world all over ſurrounded with tempeſtuous cloudes, juſt as the caſe requires: for what is involved with thicker cloudes, then the intention of mans heart? Wee heare the words, we ſee the actions, but the intentions lye hid, nor can any Lynx his eyes ever pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame. Intention is the Iudge to try, whatſoever men doe. To thoſe that are troubled with the Iaundies, and generall over-flowing of the Gall, all things ſeeme to be of a waxy and yellow colour, for the cure of this diſeaſe the hearbe <hi>Salendine</hi> is put under the ſole of the foot. There is a Iaundiſe diſeaſe of the mind, which to all that are troubled with this diſeaſe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth all things not in their owne, but in a falſe colour. He
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:170886:243"/> that deſireth to be recovered, let him begin the cure at his feet, that is, at his affections. Let him beare a mind towards others not pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, not obdurate, not diſdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not odious, not inhumane, not hoſtile; but rather gentle, courteous, facile, which may paſte over all things with a milder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which hateth the ſin, not the ſinner, which ſaith: <hi>His intention may bee otherwiſe, and better then his action: but has he done amiſſe? perhaps he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready repeated of his errour.</hi> This is a very excellent kind of mercy, to ſhew ones ſelfe benevolent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, not ſo much by giving many things, as by Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. They that drinke the juyce of <hi>Ophiuſa,</hi> an herbe growing in <hi>Aethiope,</hi> imagine that they ſee Serpents, and I know not what terrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.

For wee are convinced by theſe ſmall and eaſie things, that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend through our owne negligence and idlenes, in thoſe things alſo which ſeeme to be full of trouble. For tell me what paines is in that, that thou ſhouldſt not judge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor examine other mens faults, nor condemne the neighbour?

As often therefore as things fall out inconvenient and harſh, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous miſerable, troubleſome, he which will not be hurt, let him arme himſelfe with theſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1.

I will both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſuffer all afflictions gladly, that I may bee corrected for my former wicked life, and reape Gods favour, and the reward of glory hereafter.

That therefore they might behold with their owne eyes moſt apparantly, what an evill and miſguided intention is, it was Gods Will, that the <hi>Manna</hi> which by direction they gathered for the Sabbath, ſhould be preſerved whole, freſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, but that which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered againſt the Law for other dayes alſo, being either vitiouſly provident, or weary of taking the ſame paines againe, it was all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently corrupted, and began to ſwarme with wormes.

               <p>This God did ſet before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eyes in that manner, as if he had proclaimed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Behold yee at length O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill people; what the will in man can doe, what it is to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey or not, what a good or evill intention bringeth forth? theſe wormes are witneſſes of your rebellion, theſe fruits your head-ſtrong will, and perverſe intention produceth.

If thine eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light,</hi> Theſe eyes doe procure man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired beauty; they make him all faire. By the eye the intention of man is ſignified, as is to be ſeene by the drift of our Saviours Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: If a man have a good meaning, it ſeaſons all the reſt of
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:170886:282"/> his Actions with goodnes. And how this ſtands in it ſelfe, wee will endeavour to ſhew in ſome briefe concluſions following, ſuch as ſuite with the conſent of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines about this matter. 1. Of every good worke acceptable to God there are three conditions, 1. That malice be abſent. 2. That Grace be preſent. 3. That a right intention be not wanting. If any one of theſe bee deficient, it is a worke without deſert, neither gratefull to God nor profitable to men. As concerning the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it excludes all works in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, or the Object (as they ſay) evill. Such are luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, envy, anger, and the like. We can never call that good Cloth, which hath nere a good thread in it. The next condition of a good worke is, That the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be in favour with God, which is the foundation of all worthy Offices: as long as a man is the enemy of God, ſo long hee does not that which is pleaſing unto him. <hi>Cains</hi> offering was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, becauſe ſinne lay at the

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:170886:283"/> reward, ſo that fountaine of all merit the Divine favour bee not abſent. So by dyning, by ſupping, by ſleeping and the like, our moſt bountifull God would have us amongſt other things enabled to attaine Heaven, when as whether we eate or drinke, or whatſoever we doe, we doe it to his glory. For in ſuch an Action as theſe, thoſe three things which I ſaid meet together. 1. Malice is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for to eate, to drinke, to ſleepe and the like have no evill of themſelves. 2. Grace is preſent, for this we admit. 3. A Right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not wanting.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Concluſion</hi> is this: 1. An evill intention doeth ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate every Action, although the moſt excellent, that it makes it of no worth at all. What can a man attempt more generous, then to caſt himſelfe alive into the flames? yet if the grace of God and a right intention be wanting, this enterpriſe hath no vertue, no praiſe.

For when once they have put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in poſſeſſion, they are more maſter then the Land-lord, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not themſelves to be thruſt out or diminiſhed. Moreover reaſon it ſelf, to whom the reines are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is ſo long in power, as it is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fron the affections: but if it have mixed and contaminated it ſelfe therewith, it cannot containe them, whom it might have kept out of place. For the mind being once in a commotion and combuſtion ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to that, of which it is aſſaulted. The beginnings of ſome things are in our power: if they goe any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they carry us away with their force, and hardly leave any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to returne. As bodies violently throwne downward have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of themſelves, and cannot give backe nor tarry when they are caſt head-long, but an irrevocable precipitation cuts of al advice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and they cannot but come
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:170886:316"/> thither, whither they were not able to goe. So the mind if it diſſolutely caſt it ſelf into anger, luſt, and other paſſions, will hardly repres the force, the proclive nature of vices, will carry it away, and throw it to the very bottom. Therefore let us reſiſt vices at the threſhold; becauſe they are, as I ſaid, more eaſily not let in, then they goe out afterwards. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath commanded us a care of our ſelves, but when thou giveſt too much reſpect to this, it is vice.
